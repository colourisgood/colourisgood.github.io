It is a priority that Colour is Good be as sustainable, eco-friendly, and transparent as possible. We also want to akcnowledge it is a great privilege to have access to sources which allow us to achieve sustainable practices. Materials sourced for each handmade piece are carefully and thoughfully chosen, materials such as AAA freshwater pearls, tarnish resistant silver plated wire, sterling silver or gold filled findings, semi-precious gemstones, glass and ceramic beads. The only plastic used is the stretchy string in our rings, **BUT** we do offer the option to have them made with tarnish resistant silver plated wire instead!

Our efforts also extend to our packaging and shipping materials. Here is a list of what we use and how to recycle them:

- Paper glassine bag - curbside recyclable & biodegradable
- Kraft paper envelope - curbside recyclable
- Mailer made of 100% recycled material - curbside recyclable
- Water activated tape made from 50% recycled paper - compostable & recyclable 
- 100% recycled & zero waste shipping labels - curbside recyclable
- Thank you cards made from 100% recycled cotton - curbside recyclable 
- Protective felt pouches made from 100% recycled plastic bottles

**Do you take returns and/or exchanges?** 
All orders are **final sale**, and we cannot issue exchanges or refunds. 

**What if I entered my address wrong, can I get a refund?**
As an independent artist sadly I can not afford to issue refunds and cannot take responsibility for addresses that have been entered incorrectly. However, if you realize that you've entered the wrong address, please email us ASAP and we will do our best to rectify the error if we can.

**What are the methods of payment?**
Currently we are only accepting payment via **PAYPAL**, and is the only option available at checkout. You do not need a PAYPAL account to pay via PAYPAL, PAYPAL allows you to pay as a guest with a credit or debit card.

**Do you make customs?** 
Yes! Custom items are available, to place a custom order please contact colour.is.good.shop@gmail.com or message us on instagram @colour.is.good. Please include all the thingz, your budget, theme, size, colours, etc. 

**How much are customs pieces?**
Custom handmade pieces are made at a variety of prices, because each piece is individual so is the cost. Please note that custom projects have a longer turnaround time, approx. 2-3 weeks or shorter depending on the piece.

What we recommend to preserve your beautiful handmade pieces:

- do not wear to sleep!
- pearls should be the last thing you put on and the first to be taken off.
- keep away from excessive fragrances, oils, sunlight, or water.
- though pieces are made with tarnish resistant materials such as sterling silver plated beading wire, sterling silver and/or gold filled findings, they may tarnish. They can easily be polished using a polish cloth, and should be wiped down gently after wear.
- avoid excessive force when wearing glass beads and gemstones as it could cause them to shatter or break.

Hi! My name is Megan :) This creative endeavour, <span style="color:#4668d6;"><b>Colour is Good</b></span>, began during the pandemic and sprung out of my deep desire to cultivate a space where I could pursue my artistic passions as well as contribute to positive change in the world. For me, Colour is Good is a phrase which declares the importance of <span style="color:#4668d6;"><b>acknowledging</b></span>, <span style="color:#4668d6;"><b>respecting</b></span>, and <span style="color:#4668d6;"><b>celebrating</b></span> diverse, nuanced experiences. It is my small way of protesting a colour blind society (the sociological definition not the eye condition :wink:). As an extension of this ethos I am putting 1% of all sales towards various charities and organizations, particularly those with a focus on mental health. 

Colour is Good signifies the possibility to see the reality of what lies in front of us and importantly, the colourful complex goodness that exists within us. I believe you are a kaleidoscope of colours worth celebrating and that together, we can radiate light, love, joy, and hope.

I feel so fortunate to have access to create in this way. It is my privilege and desire to extend to others through Colour is Good the pursuit of creativity. 

Thank you for joining me in this colourful journey, I can’t wait to see where it takes us!
